 *
 * * A static schema definition that all instances of that model adhere to.
 * * A workflow for data migration, cleaning, validation, and initialization such that provided input data is structured
 *   according to the rules of the model's declared schema.
 * * A workflow for transacting differential updates to the instance data and serializing its data into format suitable
 *   for storage or transport.
 *
 * DataModel subclasses can be used for a wide variety of purposes ranging from simple game settings to high complexity
 * objects like `Scene` documents. Data models are often nested; see the {@link DataModel.parent} property for more.
