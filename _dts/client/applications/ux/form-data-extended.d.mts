/**
 * An extension of the native FormData implementation.
 *
 * This class functions the same way that the default FormData does, but it is more opinionated about how
 * input fields of certain types should be evaluated and handled.
 *
 * It also adds support for certain Foundry VTT specific concepts including:
 *  Support for defined data types and type conversion
 *  Support for TinyMCE editors
 *  Support for editable HTML elements
 *
 * @extends {FormData}
 *
 * @param {HTMLFormElement} form          The form being processed
 * @param {object} options                Options which configure form processing
 * @param {Record<string, object>} [options.editors]      A record of TinyMCE editor metadata objects, indexed by their update key
 * @param {Record<string, string>} [options.dtypes]       A mapping of data types for form fields
 * @param {boolean} [options.disabled=false]      Include disabled fields?
 * @param {boolean} [options.readonly=false]      Include readonly fields?
